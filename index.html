      <h2>February 2023 - Our First Fight</h2>
      <span class="icon">❌</span>

      <h2>August 2023 - Your First Birthday</h2>
      <span class="icon">🎂</span>
      <p> I missed your Birthday because I wasn't in the country. I wanted to be there. I got you chocolate, 😅I forgot to read the label on it. We spent so much time talking during the break. Your texts were the first thing I looked forward to every day.</p>

    <div class="card right">
      <h2>August 2023 - Our First Date</h2>
      <span class="icon">🥂</span>
      <p> My first ever date. I took you out to watch a movie. I was really nervous. You laughed through the entire horror movie while I sat there terrified. I don't remember complementing you. You looked really pretty. I'm really sorry, I didn't finish watching the YouTube video on "Things to-do and not to-do on a date".😔</p>

    <div class="card left">
      <h2>September 2023 - The First Heartbreak</h2>
      <span class="icon">💔</span>
      <p>I asked us to be friends. I wasn't sure if I was ready for a relationship and I didn't want to hurt you. I didn't know how well to express my feelings.</p>

    <div class="card right">
      <h2>December 2023 - Our First Christmas Apart</h2>
      <span class="icon">📜</span>
      <p>For every day we spent apart during the break, I wrote you a letter. I also made a playlist with a song to listen to and a movie to watch each day. Funfact: That was actually the first time I subscribed to Netflix.</p>

    <div class="card left">
      <h2>January 2024 to ∞ - Working it Out</h2>
      <span class="icon">🔨</span>
      <p>I accepted I was flawed. I spent this time working on being the person I should've been for you the first time we met. The time we spent apart felt like an eternity.</p>

    <div class="card right">
      <h2>June 2024 - Your Birthday</h2>

      <h2>October 2024 - The Second Heartbreak</h2>
      <span class="icon">💔💔</span>
